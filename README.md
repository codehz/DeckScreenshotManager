# 📸 Screenshot Uploader for Steam Deck

A **Decky Plugin** that allows you to upload screenshots directly from your **Steam Deck**.  
Since Steam Deck currently lacks native cross-uploading capabilities for screenshots, this plugin provides a seamless solution — letting you share your captures with ease.
